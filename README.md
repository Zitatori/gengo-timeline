# Japanese Era Timeline & Converter

I built this single-file web app after my friend Annu asked me what Japan’s era names like “Heisei” or “Reiwa” mean 🇯🇵.  
To make it easier to understand, I created an interactive timeline and converter that shows both **Kanji + Romaji**.

## Features
- Interactive timeline (Meiji → Reiwa)
- Era ⇄ Gregorian converter with a ↔︎ toggle
- Era table and notable events (Japan & world)
- Bilingual labels: Kanji + Romaji (e.g., 平成 (Heisei))
- No dependencies — just open `index.html`

## Live Demo
👉 After enabling GitHub Pages:  
`https://Zitatori.github.io/gengo-timeline/`

## Development
This is a single static file project.  
Edit and commit `index.html` directly.

*Year-level conversion only (exact changeover days not included).*
